            <h3>A friend rang a bell in my dream</h3>
            <p>Being part of the tech world was my long dates dream of becoming a programmer but, however, I never knew where to go study it and since I hated to be an IT technician, I found myself in the marketing world which sent my dream of becoming a programmer to bed. Four years ago, as I was sharing a business plan with a work colleague, this one rang a bell in my sleeping dream when he promised to provide a website for our business; straight away my dream woke up that I became so inquisitive to know the tools and technology he used to build the websites with but, unfortunately, he gave me tutorials on android that I couldn't handle well on my own as I was a newbie and that situation once again sent my dream of becoming programmer back to bed.</p>

            <h3>Amazon brought my dream back</h3>
            <p>Three years ago, I was about to apply for a job at Amazon and among the requirements for that marketing vacancy was this sentence "must be able to write in Html." Before I could apply for the vacancy, I went to search for HTML to really know what it was, from there my dream woke up and I never applied for that job again but rather got involved with the tech world. However, since I live my long dates dream, my decision is to make coding my professional career and I am coding for life. Two years ago, I was searching for the opportunity that I am offered by CYF, and being part of such a tech program at CYF has strengthened me a lot that I feel so proud to belong to a tech family. Therefore, I am where I was supposed to be and do what I was supposed to be doing a decade ago.</p>
